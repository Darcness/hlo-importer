## 0.2.2 (Jan 4, 2021)

* disable debug mode

## 0.2.1 (Jan 3, 2021)

* Made a proper release

## 0.2.0 (Jan 3, 2021)

* Added support for GMs to use their own User Token instead of my User Token (default). This value can be set through the module settings page. It is currently optional. I expect it will be mandatory at some time in the future.
* Added rudamentary error handling

## 0.1.2 (Jan 3, 2021)

* Change function names; I think they were possibly conflicting with Import from Pathbuilder 2e
* add debug flag to enable debug output to console

## 0.1.1 (Jan 2, 2021)

* Change Import icon to flask to imitate the flask that HLO uses for it's favicon. 
* Changed the menu title to HLO (from Import from HLO) to save some space. Title bars get pretty crowded if you have a lot of other modules that use that space.
* Prevent Import button from showing up on anything other than character sheets

## 0.1.0 (Jan 2, 2021)

* Initial Release
